a simple script to get the maps for the gas networks in Europe. To run it:
```bash
python pipe_map_generator.py
```
Or you can check the .ipynb file for a jupyter notebook implementation instead. 

the gas network data used is obtained from here: https://zenodo.org/records/4767098
and the world map dataset from here: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/
